## Installation

The program is running on Python 3, the following packages are needed: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, missingno, calendar, sklearn.

## Project Motivation

In this project, I will look at the Boston and Seattle Airbnb data, and try to answer several business questions:

1. How does the price of an Airbnb home vary by time?
2. What is the monthly occupancy of a common Airbnb home?
3. How much does an Airbnb home cost, given its property and room type?
4. How does the neighborhood affect the price of the Airbnb home?
5. How to predict the price of an Airbnb home give some of its properties?
6. How are super hosts and regular hosts reviewed by their customers?

The answers to these business questions can be helpful for the Airbnb hosts to better understand the values of their properties, and are also important for the customers to get a satisfactory Airbnb service that meets their own requirements. I will handle these problems using descriptive statistics and a linear regression model.

## File Descriptions

"AirBnb data analysis.ipynb" include the analysis on the Airbnb data using the CRISP-DM framework.
"AirBnb data analysis.html" include the same analysis in html format.
"[BostonAirbnb.zip](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston)" and "[SeattleAirbnb.zip](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)" are obtained from Kaggle. The following Airbnb activities are included in both datasets:
1. Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
2. Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
3. Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## Results

The findings can be found in a Medium post [here](https://yutao-1994.medium.com/tips-when-choosing-airbnb-analysis-on-the-boston-seattle-airbnb-data-5adb79e25327).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

I would like to give acknowledgements to Kaggle for providing the Airbnb data.
I would like to thank Udacity for the oppotunity to conduct this project.
